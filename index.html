    <h1>Endangered Species</h1>
    <p>
      - A species of animal or plant that is seriously at risk of extinction.
    </p>
    <h2>Tiger</h2>
    <p>
      After a century of decline, overall wild tiger numbers are starting to
      tick upward. Based on the best available information, tiger populations
      are stable or increasing in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China. An
      estimated 3,900 tigers remain in the wild, but much more work is needed to
      protect this species if we are to secure its future in the wild. In some
      areas, including much of Southeast Asia, tigers are still in crisis and
      declining in number.

    <h1>Reasons for Tigers becoming Endangered</h1>
    <p>
      Tigers are endangered, or in danger of disappearing from the wild. This is
      mainly because of poachers, who hunt tigers for their body parts and
      habitat loss, when people use the tigers' land, but also because they make
      bad neighbors for people.
